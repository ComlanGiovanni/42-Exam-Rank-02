--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that takes one or several strings and, for each argument,
capitalizes the first character of each word (If it's a letter, obviously),
puts the rest in lowercase, and displays the result on the standard output,
followed by a \n.

A "word" is defined as a part of a string delimited either by spaces/tabs, or
by the start/end of the string. If a word only has one letter, it must be
capitalized.

If there are no arguments, the progam must display \n.

Example:

$> ./str_capitalizer | cat -e
$
$> ./str_capitalizer "a FiRSt LiTTlE TESt" | cat -e
A First Little Test$
$> ./str_capitalizer "__SecONd teST A LITtle BiT   Moar comPLEX" "   But... This iS not THAT COMPLEX" "     Okay, this is the last 1239809147801 but not    the least    t" | cat -e
__second Test A Little Bit   Moar Complex$
   But... This Is Not That Complex$
     Okay, This Is The Last 1239809147801 But Not    The Least    T$
$>
