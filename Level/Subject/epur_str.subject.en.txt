Write a program that takes a string, and displays this string with exactly one
space between words, with no spaces or tabs either at the beginning or the end,
followed by a \n.

A "word" is defined as a part of a string delimited either by spaces/tabs, or
by the start/end of the string.

If the number of arguments is not 1, or if there are no words to display, the
program displays \n.

Example:

$> ./epur_str "See? It's easy to print the same thing" | cat -e
See? It's easy to print the same thing$
$> ./epur_str " this        time it      will     be    more complex  . " | cat -e
this time it will be more complex .$
$> ./epur_str "No S*** Sherlock..." "nAw S*** ShErLaWQ..." | cat -e
$
$> ./epur_str "" | cat -e
$
$>
