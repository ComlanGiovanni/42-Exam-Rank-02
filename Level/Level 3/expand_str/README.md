Write a program that takes a string and displays it with exactly three spaces
between each word, with no spaces or tabs either at the beginning or the end,
followed by a newline.

A word is a section of string delimited either by spaces/tabs, or by the
start/end of the string.

If the number of parameters is not 1, or if there are no words, simply display
a newline.

Examples:

$> ./expand_str "See? It's easy to print the same thing" | cat -e
See?   It's   easy   to   print   the   same   thing$
$> ./expand_str " this        time it      will     be    more complex  " | cat -e
this   time   it   will   be   more   complex$
$> ./expand_str "No S*** Sherlock..." "nAw S*** ShErLaWQ..." | cat -e
$
$> ./expand_str "" | cat -e
$
$>
```
